                <p>Sequence learning represents a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring systems to process and learn from temporal patterns. This project explores how spiking neural networks can be effectively trained to handle sequential tasks through reinforcement learning.</p>
                
                <h2>The Challenge of Temporal Learning</h2>
                <p>Traditional neural networks often struggle with temporal dependencies and sequence learning. Spiking neural networks, with their inherent temporal dynamics, offer a natural framework for addressing these challenges. However, effectively training SNNs for sequential tasks requires novel approaches that leverage their unique properties.</p>
                
                <p>The project focuses on developing reinforcement learning methods for spiking neural networks operating in unstable environments, with particular emphasis on sequence learning and temporal dynamics. This work addresses the critical need for robust, temporally-aware learning systems in real-world applications.</p>
                
                <h2>Novel Approach: Temporal Credit Assignment</h2>
                <p>We developed a novel approach to temporal credit assignment in spiking neural networks that addresses the challenges of learning in unstable environments. The method combines several innovative techniques:</p>
                
                <h3>Adaptive Time Windows</h3>
                <p>Dynamic adjustment of temporal learning windows based on task complexity. This allows the network to focus on relevant temporal patterns while ignoring irrelevant noise, improving learning efficiency and robustness.</p>
                
                <h3>Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)</h3>

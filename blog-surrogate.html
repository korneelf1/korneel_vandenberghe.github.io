                <p>Surrogate gradients have become a cornerstone technique for training spiking neural networks, but their impact on network performance and training dynamics remains incompletely understood. This research project systematically investigates the effects of different surrogate gradient methods on deep neural network training.</p>
                
                <h2>The Surrogate Gradient Problem</h2>
                <p>Spiking neural networks face a fundamental challenge: the spike function is non-differentiable, making traditional backpropagation impossible. Surrogate gradients provide a solution by approximating the derivative of the spike function, enabling gradient-based learning.</p>
                
                <p>This research addresses the critical question of how different surrogate gradient methods affect training stability, convergence speed, and final network performance. Understanding these effects is essential for developing more effective training strategies for spiking neural networks.</p>
                
                <h2>Experimental Methodology</h2>
                <p>We conducted extensive experiments comparing multiple surrogate gradient methods across various network architectures and tasks. The study focused on understanding the trade-offs between different approaches and their suitability for different applications.</p>
